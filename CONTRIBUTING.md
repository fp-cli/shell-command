Contributing
============

We appreciate you taking the initiative to contribute to this project.

Contributing isnâ€™t limited to just code. We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local meetup, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our documentation.

For a more thorough introduction, [check out FP-CLI's guide to contributing](https://make.finpress.org/cli/handbook/contributing/). This package follows those policy and guidelines.
